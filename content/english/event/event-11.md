### About Event
We had 3 days event for Deepavali - 
- **Day 1**: Spreading awareness on going _Vocal for Local_--- We held placards and spoke about the same in the traffic signals to encourage everyone to buy _diyas_ from local vendors & support them.

- **Day 2**: We had online event which was held to know how Diwali is celebrated all over the world & we had fun quiz.

- **Day 3**: Morning, we visited an two orphanges, distributed some play items and gifts, and had some good time with the kids. Evening, we visited Basaveshwaranagara police station, decorated the station by lighting the lamps we bought on Day 1 and Distributed Masks & Sanitizers to all the Police men & women in the station as a regard for their service during lock down.
