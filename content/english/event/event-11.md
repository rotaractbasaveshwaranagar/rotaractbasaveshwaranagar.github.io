### About Event
We had 3 days event for Deepavali:
Day 1: Spreading awareness on going Vocal for Local.
We held placards in the signals to encourage everyone to buy Diyas from Local vendors & support them.

Day 2: We had online event which was held to know how Diwali is celebrated all over the world & we had fun quiz.

Day 3: We visited Basaveshwaranagara police station, decorated the station by lighting the lamps we bought on Day 1 and Distributed Masks & Sanitizers to all the Police men & women in the station as a regard for their service during lock down.
