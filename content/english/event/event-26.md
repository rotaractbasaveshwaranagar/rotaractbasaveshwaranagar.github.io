### About Event
A 14-member squad who have just met each other went on a trip to Udupi. Led by Rtr. Sirisha and Rtr. Thejaswini, the members enjoyed the local culture, played outdoor games like Lagori and cricket and learnt some farming. The crazy dances by members was a sight to behold. Some members got massively penalized in UNO.
