### About Event
Sowâ€™em all was one of the interesting events that aimed at involving every member to see something grow and learn that everything is a process that needs constant attention by addition of efforts just like the pack of seeds needed to grow by sprouting and develop into a beautiful plant.  
Members participated with a good spirit and nourished the seeds very well.
