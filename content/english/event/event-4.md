### About Event

We started feeding dogs in and around Rajajinagar and are actively involved in rescuing and caring for distressed animals and birds. We used to feed around 60 dogs every day and the current pandemic has made that list longer. As soon as the lockdown was imposed, we started cooking in larger quantity at one place and distributed it to our feeders who used to feed in different areas. The list grew to _750+ dogs, 50+ cats, 30+ pigs and cows_ in no time. The volunteers relentlessly fed the animals for five months. When the lockdown was lifted, we identified areas where the animals were being well-fed and slowly decreased the number to 450 dogs, 20+ cats and around 15 pigs. Chicken and rice are fed for the dogs, occasionally they are also fed Pedigree gravy and dry food. Cats are fed Whiskas and vegetables are fed to cows and pigs. The feeding locations include in and around Rajajinagar. Some areas near Rajajinagar are covered as well. We feed on main roads, industrial areas, landfills, dump yard, basically regions where the animals are in large numbers but food is scarce. 
We have also managed to get over 70 dogs neutered before lockdown and 50 after the lockdown was imposed. We _vaccinated 40+ dogs_ in the last one year. 
We mostly fund our own rescues and feeding and sometimes have generous donors who support our initiative. We installed _50+ water bowls_ in different areas in the last few months and have put reflective collars on 50+ dogs.
