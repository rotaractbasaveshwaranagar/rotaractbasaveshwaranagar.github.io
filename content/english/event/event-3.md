### About Event

SpeakEasy is a means for the general public to learn a new language and culture - online completely for free. Language and culture define a person. This initiative is an effort from Rotaract Bangalore Basaveshwaranagar to engage different people and cultures. To start with, we have chosen the regional language Tulu. Majority of the users of this language hail predominantly from the coastal land of Mangalore, Kasaragod and Udupi. We feel that during such a time of the world that is affected by the pandemic, one can only learn new things and face the challenges ahead. We are often used to learning what is taught at home and we become more reserved to our own ways of life. With such initiatives, we feel that we will become more unprejudiced and discover new ways to connect with each other and imbibe a sense of oneness. India being a land rich in culture and diversity, we should be blessed and happy that we are so different, but yet the same in many ways.
